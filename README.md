This demo uses Docker and Docker Compose to provision the stack, but all you actually need for getting data from Kafka to Elasticsearch is Apache Kafka and the Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Sink connector. It also uses ksqlDB as an easy interface for producing/consuming from Kafka topics, and creating Kafka Connect connectors - but you donâ€™t have to use it in order to use Kafka Connect.
